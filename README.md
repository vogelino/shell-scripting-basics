# Shell scripting tutorial
Repository where I collect knowledge about shell scripting as I learn about it.

## Resources
- [tutorialspoint.com - Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/shell_scripting.htm)

## Run the examples
1. Clone the repository
1. Make the scripts in the `./scripts` folder executable using `chmod +x ./scripts/**/*.sh`
1. Run any script by calling its path. E.g. `./scripts/001-read-input.sh`

## Continue learning
Run npm script:
```sh
npm run learn
```
